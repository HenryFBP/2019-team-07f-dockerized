# What does our application do?
## a. Create a system allowing users to create accounts and upload video, using a speech to text library (cloud based or opensource) to create text transcripts of these videos
How do we implement the creation of accounts and the upload of videos?
### A- User Interface Side:
-Create an index
-Create a detailed information page to be filled up (to allow a user to create his account)
-Create a user page once the user has been authenticated (user dashboard)

### B- Database Side:
-Create a database that stores users credentials
-Create a database that stores videos

### C- Authentication (authentication method)
- Create a server to authenticate a users

### D- Upload video.

### E-Speech to Text Library.

-We can use Python libraries and Google Speech API.


## b. Include solution for storage of videos and cost justification
-Will be stored in the database (mysql may be). 

## c. Using a Hadoop/Solr/Lucene based application create an search engine to allow for searching of phrases and correlation with timestamp index in the corresponding video
