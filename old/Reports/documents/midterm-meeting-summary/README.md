# Status update

Alright, here's the deal. I've done most of this project. It's been unfair to me
and has taken its toll on me mentally and I've reached a breaking point. I have
too much stress to continue.

I've decided that to make this fair, I've made a list of tasks that I want five
of finished. I'll give you all **two weeks** to accomplish these tasks, and if five
aren't finished by that time, I'm going to cut my losses and become a one-person
group.

All of these tasks are independent of each other and not terribly difficult to
accomplish. You are to use Google, and self-research if you do not know how to
do a task. I personally didn't know what Vagrant or Packer were before this
class, but was able to learn them, so you can learn this.

If you all can do any 5 of these tasks in two weeks, I will stay in this group.

I WILL check commits, so do not have one person do all of the tasks.

# Tasks

1.  Add CSS to the web server servlet (`/server/WebContent/resources/css/`) 
and ensure the CSS is clean-looking and simple. Don't use the OLD CSS, it was much too messy.

1.  Finish setting up an iSCSI target on the iSCSI box, and ensure it can be
mounted as a drive. Add a few test file transfers in the `Vagrantfile` that test
both the iSCSI target and initiator.

1.  Add 4 database entities that are related to the `Person` object. These are
.java files that Hibernate will use to create tables.
    
1.  Add a video upload form that inserts a video's information to the `Video`
table in the MySQL database. It should also upload the file to the webserver 
(no iSCSI needed yet)
    
1.  Generate an SSL certificate and add it to the Apache Tomcat server in the
Vagrant provisioning step. Verify HTTPS works.
    
1.  Convert a video to audio using a Java library. Add this as a unit test to
verify that this works. Make sure it works within the web server.
