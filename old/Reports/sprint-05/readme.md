# 1. Languages and Frameworks

## a. Programming Language and Language Framework

### Java DK 1.8.0_191 and Kotlin 1.3

Java is primarily used for our web server logic, our modeling business objects,
and to present our data.

Kotlin is used in our project because it works very well alongside Java.

Kotlin provides syntax shortcuts and more functions that may be used with existing
Java .class objects.

### Java Server Faces 2.1

Java Server Faces (JSF) is used to present our web application logic.

JSF provides better security benefits and the platform to easily create complex xHTML
elements.

### Apache Tomcat 8 and 9

Apache Tomcat is used to deploy our web application locally for development and testing.

Apache Tomcat 8 is being used in our Virtual Machines while our development is done in
Apache Tomcat 9 web server.

### Spring Boot

Spring Boot is used to make configurations more simple.

Spring Boot gathers all of our configuration files and implements them in a file called
'applicationContext.xml'.

### Hibernate / Hibernate Query Language (HQL)

Hibernate is used as an Object Relational Mapping engine for CRUD (Create, Read, Update Delete)
operations and is the link between our database and our web application.

Hibernate uses annotations on Java Objects and inserts them into a database table.

Hibernate also uses SQL queries for CRUD operations, also known as Hibernate Query Language.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is used as the connection driver for Hibernate so that
we may connect to our MySQL database.

# 2. Operating System Platform of Choice

## a. Which Operating System and Why?

The current Operating System is running on Ubuntu Server 16.04 for all of our Virtual Machines.

We chose Ubuntu Server OS because of how easy it is to configure and use.

## b. Packages - List All Additional Packages Installed

## d. Implementation and Collection of Application Metrics and Monitoring

There is a `Jenkinsfile` at the root of the repo that will build, deploy, and test this
repository's code commits.

![Jenkin's Stage View](img/jenkins.PNG)

Application Metrics are currently captured for all virtual machines.

Both netdata and the html file '/2019-team-07f/metrics/three_servers.html' is our centralized
place to monitor the performance and stability of our application.

Netdata graphs may be seen at their respective links.

localhost:19999
![netdata web](img/netdataweb.PNG)

localhost:19998
![netdata db](img/netdatadb.PNG)

localhost:19997
![netdata storage](img/netdatastorage.PNG)

These graphs may be seen by opening up three_servers.html in the team metrics folder.

![db graphs](img/dbgraphs.PNG)
![storage graphs](img/storagegraphs.PNG)

## e. Destroy Script

Script command: `ruby destroy-everything.rb -f` (must have Ruby installed)

With the '-f' flag, it will force (automatically confirm) through the confirmation prompt.

# 3. Use of Data Store/Storage

## a. Database or Similar Storage Technology

We are currently utilizing MySQL 5.7 as our database to store all user information such as
usernames, names, emails, passwords, and etc.

Our MySQL server is separated into it's own virtual box.

We are also currently using NFS to store all media files such as MP3/MP4 files.

NFS is also separated onto it's own virtual box and acts as our file storage.

A table called Video has been created to store video information such as ID, Title, Details,
Type, and Size.

Other tables such as Audio, Text, and Details were also created to store
respective information.

Since we are using Hibernate, we can store a "Person" object without any SQL code/queries.

# 4. Data Encryption at Rest

Information/data is currently stored in the MySQL database in plaintext view.

All new user passwords are hashed and salted.

Data Encryption at rest is still planned for future implementation.

# 5. Database Makes Use of Master/Slave Replication:

## a. Schema Creation

We are using a single MySQL database with a single schema.

## b. Caching Layer Implementation

We currently have no caching layer.

## c & d. Master for Database Writes & Slave for Database Reads

Since the database is separated, it makes making master/slave boxes easier.

# 6. Use of Responsive design

## Explain What Framework Allows for Responsive Design in your Project

We are not using any framework for responsive design.
We are utilizing plain CSS skills to achieve a clean and smooth responsive interface.

Plain CSS is used to build responsive screens. We are using mobile-first designs and use
relative units and relative positioning to allow our interface to adapt to all screen sizes.

# 7. Use of HTTPS

## a. Self-signed Certificates

We can create certificates locally, but it is currently not automated.

## b. Login Authentication Mechanism

### i. Describe How You Are Doing This

We are using Java Server Faces (JSF) alongside a Server Filter and a Session Managed Bean
to authenticate users and ensure that only authenticated users may access certain pages.

Our login authentication mechanism is currently working and authenticates to our
database with correct user login information.
This was done through Hibernate Query Language (HQL).

### ii. Describe How You Are Securing This

The username is stored in a Java Servlet Session that the user can identify via a cookie.

There is built-in Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the form of a
cryptographic nonce that gets inserted with all forms.

## c. Explanation of Security Assumptions

### i. Firewall

We have port 8080 open for HTTP on the web box and port 19999 is open for netdata on all boxes.

### ii. Authentication Keys

Authentication keys are to be stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` on the host.

These are RSA private keys.

They are copied to the VM's disk and used to clone the git repository.
Thereafter, they are removed from the virtual machine.

### iii. Seeding of Usernames and Passwords

We have seeded the database with 15 test users.

```sql
    INSERT INTO `person` (country, email, name, password, username)
    VALUES ('USA', 'hpost@hawk.iit.edu', 'Henry Post', 'forkbomb123', 'hpost'),
           ('USA', 'npatel117@hawk.iit.edu', 'Nihar Patel', 'pmsrock!!', 'npatel117'),
           ('USA', 'ifagbemi@hawk.iit.edu', 'Idris Fagbemi', 'dev4life', 'ifagbemi'),
           ('USA', 'dbaniekona@hawk.iit.edu', 'Divin Gregis Baniekona', 'itopsguy456', 'dbaniekona'),
           ('USA', 'ylin95@hawk.iit.edu', 'Yi Ting Lin', 'yitingrox', 'ylin95'),
           ('USA', 'jtron82@hawk.iit.edu', 'Jimmy Tran', 'uiuxuxui', 'jtron82'),

           ('Dominican Republic', 'carrjess21@gmail.com', 'Jessie Caraballo', 'carrain$!', 'jessiecar2'),
           ('Albania', 'vgoj@gmail.com', 'Victor Gojcaj', 'nycisforme', 'vgoj'),
           /*(...)*/
```

### iv. Pre-seeding Databases with Schema and Records

We have an SQL script that creates a schema called 'searchable-video-library' when executed.

All the tables are created from Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) with Hibernate annotations
and are created at runtime of the Apache servlet.

```java

    package com.teamteem.model;

    import javax.faces.bean.ManagedBean;
    import javax.persistence.*;
    import java.util.Set;

    @Entity
    @Table(name = "person")
    @ManagedBean(name = "person")
    public class Person {

        @Id
        @Column(name = "id")
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        private int id;

        private String name;

        @Column(unique = true)
        private String username;

        @Column(unique = true)
        private String email;

        private String country;

        private String password;

        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "person")
        private Set<Video> videos;

        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "person")
        private Set<Audio> audios;

        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "person")
        private Set<Text> texts;

        //(...)

    }
```

# 8. Use of User Authentication

## a. Must use HTTP/webserver Session

User sessions work by saving a username to a `jsessionid`.

This allows an authenticated user to have a session after logging in with a valid
username and password.

## b. Different UI for Unauthenticated Users

The UI for Unauthenticated Users is the same for Authenticated Users.

## c. Different UI for Authenticated Users

The UI for Authenticated Users is the same for Unauthenticated Users.

## d. Different UI for Administrative Users

The UI for Administrative User is the same as Unauthenticated and Authenticated Users.

## e. UI is Modified per Authenticated User via CSS

The UI is the same for all users.

# 9. Creation of Dev Environment (local laptop):

## a) Must Work According to Specification

Setting up an IDE as well as specific versions for required software are documented.

The development environment is not created automatically but is documented.

Running `ruby /packer/build-missing.rb` will build all missing packer boxes.
Running `vagrant up` in `/` will bring the virtual machines up.

## b) Environment Must Be Configurable via a Script Pre-Deploy

All global configuration are stored in `/variables.yml`

## c) Explanation of UI/UX Testing Methodology

As of now we only test and report bugs in UI/UX components.

## d) GitHub Bug Reports & Trello Closed Bug Report Card Proof

Although some bugs were corrected this sprint, none of which were recorded.

# 10. Layout Design

## a & b. Diagrams of Site Functionality & Other Usability Features

This is the home page layout of our website.

At the top of the page, there is a navigation bar to guide users through different pages.
