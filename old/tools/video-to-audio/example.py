"""This file shows you how to use the V2AServer, if the tests weren't enough.

We convert our "potato.mp4" example video into "./temp/potato.mp3" here.

This example is the SIMPLEST usage of this program.

You can see in my test cases I use pipes and threads and other crazy stuff, and that's something you can do too, but
for simple usages like this, stuff like passing file descriptors is totally fine to do.

See test cases for more notes and advanced usage.
